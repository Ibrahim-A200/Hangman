# Hangman Game  

Dive into this simple and interactive Hangman game! This project showcases fundamental Python programming concepts, including loops, functions, object-oriented programming (OOP), and more.  

## Features  
- **Engaging Gameplay**: A fun guessing game with a text-based interface.  
- **Customizable Word List**: Swap in your own words or use the provided default list.  
- **Structured Code**: Organized with classes and methods for better readability and expansion.  
- **Replay Option**: Keep playing without restarting the program.  

## Skills Demonstrated  
This project is a great way to explore key Python concepts, such as:  
- **Loops** for controlling the game flow and tracking guesses.  
- **Functions** to break down tasks into manageable pieces of code.  
- **Classes and Objects** to handle game logic and data cleanly.  
- **File I/O** (optional) for reading words from an external file.
